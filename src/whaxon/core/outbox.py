"""Durable at-least-once lifecycle event delivery for Engine V2 E3.

Lifecycle event storage and consumer cursors are authoritative in JobStore.
A callback may produce an external effect before failing; the cursor then
remains unacknowledged, permitting duplicate delivery after restart. Receivers
must deduplicate by (plan_id, event.id); exactly-once is NOT guaranteed.
